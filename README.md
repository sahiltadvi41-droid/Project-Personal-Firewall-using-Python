# Project-Personal-Firewall-using-Python
# Introduction
In the modern digital landscape, the rise in cyber threats makes personal security tools increasingly essential. This project aims to develop a lightweight personal firewall using Python. It is capable of sniffing, filtering, and logging network traffic based on customizable rules. This firewall is ideal for learning network security concepts and creating a foundational security tool.
# Abstract
This project demonstrates the creation of a personal firewall that captures and filters network traffic in real-time using Python and the Scapy library. The firewall applies user-defined rules to allow or block packets based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols. Logged data provides visibility into allowed and blocked communications, while optional integrations with Linux iptables and a Tkinter GUI add enforcement and interactivity.
# Tools Used
Python 3
Scapy (pip install scapy)
Linux iptables (for enforcing rules)
Tkinter (for optional GUI interface)
Text editor (e.g., VS Code, nano)
# Features
Real-time packet sniffing using Scapy
Rule-based filtering for IP, port, protocol
Activity logging with timestamps
Optional iptables integration for system-level enforcement
Optional Tkinter-based GUI for live monitoring
